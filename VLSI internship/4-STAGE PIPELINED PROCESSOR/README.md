# 4-Stage Pipelined Processor Simulation

This project demonstrates a basic 4-stage pipelined processor using MATLAB.

## Pipeline Stages
1. IF  - Instruction Fetch
2. ID  - Instruction Decode
3. EX  - Execute
4. WB  - Write Back

## Description
- Instructions like ADD, SUB, and LOAD are simulated.
- Each clock cycle shows how instructions move through the pipeline.
- MATLAB script prints stage activity per cycle.

## Files
- pipeline_sim.m : MATLAB simulation code
- Screenshot     : Output showing pipeline stages

## Result
The simulation clearly shows overlapped execution of instructions across pipeline stages.
